## Sintel license

My model used "Sintel Lite 2.57b" by BenDansie as a base. The file "BLENDSWAP_LICENSE.txt" contains original license file as downloaded from [https://blendswap.com/blend/2847](https://blendswap.com/blend/2847). Assets:

- Base mesh (in the .fbx file). I've updated vertex positions, added shape keys, replaced materials and much more.
- All eye textures. Ofc. I've heavily painted over albedo eye texture.
- `sintel_hair_shadow.jpg`
