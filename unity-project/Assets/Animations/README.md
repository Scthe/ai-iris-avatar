# Licensing

All `.anim` files are based on animations from [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/). It's a popular animation library frequently used with Unity.

AFAIK latest license data comes from ["Mixamo FAQ - Licensing, Royalties, Ownership, EULA and TOS"](https://community.adobe.com/t5/mixamo-discussions/mixamo-faq-licensing-royalties-ownership-eula-and-tos/td-p/13234775). This is also [explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/ougydm/why_mixamo_is_free/) by one of the pre-Adobe mixamo employees. Or on the [forums](https://community.adobe.com/t5/mixamo-discussions/the-license-to-use-mixamo/td-p/13222648). Since I'm not distributing/reselling the raw files, I believe this is well within the rights to use.

You can see same approach in belowed by Unity community [Mix and Jam](https://www.youtube.com/@mixandjam/videos) YouTube channel. They frequently [use](https://youtu.be/xzFsbQEqFdg?si=Nd6izVI8QovP5kWs&t=401) mixamo animations to reimplement popular video game mechanics. Then, the whole project (including animations) is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mixandjam/ThePathless-Gameplay).
